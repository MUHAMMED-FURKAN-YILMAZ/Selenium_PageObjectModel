 ***************** NoSuchElementException: **********************
    Reason:
-Locater iswrong
-Element is not on the page because of the iframe or pop up or new window
-Loading issue-synchronization issue
-Element is hidden

    Solution:
-Make sure locatoe is correct
-Do manuel testing to make sure there is no iframe, pop ups or any other blocked on the page
-If locator is correct and if we used correct switch(iframe, new window, etc..) then aplly wait
-Sometimes implicit wait may not be enough to handle specific issue. For example, when we test reservation
functionality, after clicking save button, we had to put explicit wait to verify the success message on the popup window
-Try using expilicit wait. It that doesn't work, then try thread.sleep as a last resort


 ***************** TimeOutException: **********************
    Reason:
-After applying selenium waits, if the element is still not visible after a time is over, then
 we see TimeOutException
-Simply put, wait time is over but the commend is not completed

    Solution:
-Increase the wait time
-Try using different wait. For example try using javascript executor wait for the page to
 load. This is also a dynamic wait
-Try using different wait. For example try using javascript executor wait for the page to
 load. This is also a dynamic wait
-Case by case, I prefer different explicit waits to maximize the performance of the
 automation script


 ***************** NullPointerException: **********************
    Reason:
-When a variable is created, but not instantiated, when pointer does not show any value
then we get NullPointerException.
-It is common to for to initialize the Driver, they we get the exaction. Driver driver;
but never use driver=new ChromeDriver()
-For example, in my page object model, I create page objects in test classes but when I forgot to use
 new keyword to instantiate, then I get the exception

    Solution:
-Instantiate the variable


***************** WebDriverException: **********************
    Reason:
-When you close the browser, but still want to use that in correctly
-When the versions of the driver and browsers are not compatible
-

    Solution:
-Your design should be good. We should use singleton Driver to
 prevent this exception
-Keep drivers up to date that is compatible with the browser version


***************** StaleElementReferenceException: **********************
    Reason:
-When the element is no longer fresh on the page and you try to use it
-When the element is detached from the Dom
-When the element is removed after session started

    Solution:
-We might have to relocate the same element again
